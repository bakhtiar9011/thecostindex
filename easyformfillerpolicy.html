  <h1>Privacy Policy for Easy Form Filler</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> August 12, 2025</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Easy Form Filler is a Chrome Extension that helps you save and reuse your personal or professional
    details for quick form filling. Your data stays on your device and is only used when you choose
    to fill in a form or request an AI-generated response.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    The extension may store the following <strong>personally identifiable information</strong> (PII) if you choose to provide it:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Name</li>
    <li>Email address</li>
    <li>Phone number</li>
    <li>Postal address</li>
    <li>Job title, work experience, and education history</li>
    <li>Skills and other additional information you manually enter</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    No other categories of data (such as health information, financial information, authentication credentials, or web history) are collected.
  </p>

  <h2>How Your Data Is Stored</h2>
  <p>
    All data you save in Easy Form Filler is stored locally on your device using <code>chrome.storage.local</code>.
    This means:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The data is not automatically sent to any server controlled by us.</li>
    <li>The data is only accessible to the Easy Form Filler extension running in your browser.</li>
    <li>You can delete your saved data at any time via the extension’s options page.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How Your Data Is Used</h2>
  <p>
    Your stored information is used solely to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fill form fields on websites when you drag-and-drop or click “Paste” in the extension.</li>
    <li>Generate AI responses (if you use the AI feature), in which case the necessary details are sent to the OpenAI API <em>only</em> for the purpose of generating the requested response.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do not sell, rent, or share your data with third parties for advertising or marketing purposes.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    If you use the AI response feature, your relevant saved data (e.g., job title, skills, experience) may be sent to OpenAI’s API to generate a response to your question.
    This data transfer happens only when you explicitly request it.  
    OpenAI processes the request and returns the generated text. You can review OpenAI’s privacy policy here:  
    <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy</a>
  </p>

  <h2>Permissions Explanation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>storage</strong> – to save your profile, work experience, education, skills, and additional info locally.</li>
    <li><strong>activeTab</strong> – to allow the extension to interact with the currently active web page when you activate it.</li>
    <li><strong>scripting</strong> – to inject the form-filling tools and UI into web pages.</li>
    <li><strong>clipboardWrite</strong> – to copy your stored information to the clipboard when you use the “Paste” feature.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>
    You can delete all stored data at any time from the extension’s options page.  
    If you stop using the extension, uninstalling it will remove all locally stored data from your browser.
  </p>

  <h2>Certifications</h2>
  <p>
    We certify that:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not sell or transfer user data to third parties, outside of the approved use cases.</li>
    <li>We do not use or transfer user data for purposes that are unrelated to the extension’s single purpose.</li>
    <li>We do not use or transfer user data to determine creditworthiness or for lending purposes.</li>
  </ul>
